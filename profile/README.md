## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Contribution guide:


## Current Priority Project

### Translation of Linuxize: 

1. Select item you would like to work with from [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/Open-Source-Azerbaijan/projects/1)

2. Clone repository to your local machine from origin

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:Open-Source-Azerbaijan/linuxjourney.git && cd linuxjourney
```

3. Create branch for your assignement (example: file-permissions)

```bash
git checkout -b file-permissions
```

4. Do your changes to files

5. Check for changes
```bash
git status
```

6. Add files you want to add/commit (example file-permissions)

Add all files:
```bash
git add -A .
```
OR

Add interactively one by one:
```bash
git add -i
```

OR

Add only part of changes made:
```bash
git add -e
```

7. Create commit with message (message shall describe changes clearly)
```bash
git commit -m "updated some text"
```

8. Set origin (example file-permissions branch)

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin file-permissions 
```

9. Push changes to origin 
```bash
git push
```

10. Create draft pull request
it is easier done from github interface:

11. And because this is Forked from linuxjourney, and we plan to commit all changes to it later all together
Select Open Source Azerbaijan as target for PR

12. Also we need to select not only Repositry but a proper branch for PR (select Main, not master!)
